<H3><A NAME="s3">3. Configuration</A></H3>

<P>Using the option menu one can control much of konsole's appearance.
The configuration is both available using the menu bar or clicking
on konsole's window with the right mouse button.
<UL>
<LI>Menu Bar
<P>Having this option checked provides a menu bar in the top of the
window. Different from the regular behavior, the menu bar does
not accept "hot keys" to prevent making some ALT-key combinations
unusable for the client applications.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Frame
<P>Selects whether a decorating border is to be drawn.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Scrollbar
<P>Having a scrollbar provides another way to control the history
buffer. Do not confuse this feature with scrolling inside the
client application, although it often may (and shall) look like.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Font
<P>The font menu offers two completely different adjustments.
First, a collection of fonts of different sizes given, so
that a font that matches both the resolution and the prefered
window size can be chosen. Second, there is one additional
"Linux" font, that is different from all the above by it's
encoding. One needs to have this font set when running a
linux console emulation.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Size
<P>While the size of the window is freely adjustable by the regular
means, it may sometimes be desireable to set the size of konsole
window to match the requierements of old, size unaware programs.
The size menu offeres the most often used sizes. If non of them
match, resize the screen due to your needs. When the size is
changed, konsole displays it in the title to help with the
adjustment.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>Color Schema
<P>This option allows one to select a color schema.
(A section explaining how is missing, see /opt/kde/share/apps/konsole
for some examples.)
<P>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>For more historical reasons, the backspace key shall not emit
CTRL-H when running with Linux. (The only application that i
know which really depends on this special behavior is "emacs",
where CTRL-H means "Help"). Although every application is
properly configurable, so one could have configured emacs to
accept F1 as the help key, an uncommon use of the keyboard
codes has been traditionalized. Don't worry about it, just
make sure that the option
<UL>
<LI>BS sends DEL</LI>
</UL>

is checked.
<P>In this case, konsole send a DEL character (hex 7F) when pressing
the backspace key instead of the regular BS character (hex 08).
The delete key is also sending something different from the DEL
character in this case.
<P>All the above options take effect immediately but only for the
current invocation. To make the adjustments permanent, click the
option:
<UL>
<LI>Save options</LI>
