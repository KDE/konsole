The following table of the ANSI X3.64 encodings is the result of some work I
did a few years ago for BYTE magazine.  BYTE made this table available for
download from several bulletin-board systems, so I see no reason why it cannot
be posted here for whatever private use you care to make.  Just don't expect
to make a profit selling copies of it without paying royalties to McGraw-Hill.

Oh, by the way, the equivalent ISO standard is DP-6429.

 ANSI Standard (X3.64) Control Sequences for Video Terminals and Peripherals
                       in alphabetic order by mnemonic

     (Inspired by the article "Toward Standardized Video Terminals: ANSI
      X3.64 Device Control" by Mark L. Siegel, April 1984 BYTE, page 365)

Abbreviations:

Intro  an Introducer of some kind of defined sequence; the normal 7-bit
       X3.64 Control Sequence Introducer is the two characters "Escape ["

Delim  a Delimiter

x/y    identifies a character by position in the ASCII table (column/row)

eF     editor function (see explanation)

FE     format effector (see explanation)

F      is a Final character in
            an Escape sequence (F from 3/0 to 7/14 in the ASCII table)
            a control sequence (F from 4/0 to 7/14)

Gs     is a graphic character appearing in strings (Gs ranges from
       2/0 to 7/14) in the ASCII table

Ce     is a control represented as a single bit combination in the C1 set
       of controls in an 8-bit character set

C0     the familiar set of 7-bit ASCII control characters

C1     roughly, the set of control characters available only in 8-bit systems.
       This is too complicated to explain fully here, so read Jim Fleming's
       article in the February 1983 BYTE, especially pages 214 through 224.

Fe     is a Final character of a 2-character Escape sequence that has an
       equivalent representation in an 8-bit environment as a Ce-type
       (Fe ranges from 4/0 to 5/15)

Fs     is a Final character of a 2-character Escape sequence that is
       standardized internationally with identical representation in 7-bit
       and 8-bit environments and is independent of the currently
       designated C0 and C1 control sets (Fs ranges from 6/0 to 7/14)

I      is an Intermediate character from 2/0 to 2/15 (inclusive) in the
       ASCII table

P      is a parameter character from 3/0 to 3/15 (inclusive) in the ASCII
       table

Pn     is a numeric parameter in a control sequence, a string of zero or
       more characters ranging from 3/0 to 3/9 in the ASCII table

Ps     is a variable number of selective parameters in a control sequence
       with each selective parameter separated from the other by the code
       3/11 (which usually represents a semicolon); Ps ranges from
       3/0 to 3/9 and includes 3/11

Format Effectors versus Editor Functions

A format effector specifies how the final output is to be created.
An editor function allows you to modify the specification.

For instance, a format effector that moves the "active position" (the
cursor or equvalent) one space to the left would be useful when you want to
create an overstrike, a compound character made of two standard characters
overlaid. Control-H, the Backspace character, is actually supposed to be a
format effector, so you can do this. But many systems use it in a
nonstandard fashion, as an editor function, deleting the character to the
left of the cursor and moving the cursor left. When Control-H is assumed to
be an editor function, you cannot predict whether its use will create an
overstrike unless you also know whether the output device is in an "insert
mode" or an "overwrite mode". When Control-H is used as a format effector,
its effect can always be predicted. The familiar characters carriage
return, linefeed, formfeed, etc., are defined as format effectors.

NOTES ON THE DEC VT100 IMPLEMENTATION

In the case of the popular DEC VT100 video-terminal implementation,
the only mode that may be altered is the linefeed/newline (LNM) mode.
Other modes are considered permanently set, reset, or not applicable
as follows:

     Set:   ERM
     Reset: CRM, EBM, FEAM, FETM, IRM, KAM, PUM, SRTM, TSM
     N/A:   GATM, HEM, MATM, SATM, TTM, VEM

Control sequences implemented in the VT100 are as follows:

     CPR, CUB, CUD, CUF, CUP, CUU, DA, DSR, ED, EL, HTS, HVP, IND,
     LNM, NEL, RI, RIS, RM, SGR, SM, TBC

plus several private DEC commands.

Erasing parts of the display (EL and ED) in the VT100 is performed thus:

     Erase from cursor to end of line           Esc [ 0 K    or Esc [ K
     Erase from beginning of line to cursor     Esc [ 1 K
     Erase line containing cursor               Esc [ 2 K
     Erase from cursor to end of screen         Esc [ 0 J    or Esc [ J
     Erase from beginning of screen to cursor   Esc [ 1 J
     Erase entire screen                        Esc [ 2 J

The VT100 responds to receiving the DA (Device Attributes) control

     Esc [ c    (or Esc [ 0 c)

by transmitting the sequence

     Esc [ ? l ; Ps c

where Ps is a character that describes installed options.

The VT100's cursor location can be read with the DSR (Device Status
Report) control

     Esc [ 6 n

The VT100 reports by transmitting the CPR sequence

     Esc [ Pl ; Pc R

where Pl is the line number and Pc is the column number (in decimal).

The complete document describing the standard,  "ANSI X3.64-1979:
Additional Controls for Use with the American National Standard
Code for Information Interchange," can be ordered for $13.50 (plus
$4 postage) from

     Standards Sales Department
     American National Standards Institute
     1430 Broadway
     New York, NY 10018
     212/354-3300

It's best to read the full standard before using it. It also helps
to have copies of the related standards "X3.4-1977: American
National Standard Code for Information Interchange" (the ASCII
standard) and "X3.41.1974: Code-Extension Techniques for Use with
the 7-Bit Coded Character Set of American National Standard for
Information Interchange."

See also the chapter "Using Extended Screens and Keyboard Control"
in the IBM PC-DOS manuals, especially for the coding for character
attributes.

The specification for the DEC VT100 is document EK-VT100-UG-003.
