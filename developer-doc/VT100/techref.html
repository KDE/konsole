<h2>Preface</h2>

This document accompanies the Konsole program, which is a terminal emulation
for the X Windows System.  Since material about the extend and precise semantics
of the emulatation intended to be handled by this programs is hard to find on the
internet today, it came out nessesary to include a more precise specification within
their release.
Hopefully, this helps to clearify the relation to the VT100, VT102, Linux, XTerm
and ansi.sys (ANSI-BBS) terminals, which are the target of these programs. Further,
it specifies which codes are interpreted by them, and what has been omitted.
<p>
To begin with, all of the above call themselfes "ANSI" emulations, which makes this
notion pretty vage. "ANSI" referes here to the American National Standards 
Institute's documents X3.41-1974 and X3.64-1977. DEC partially implemented this
standart in their VT100 terminal, with some additions. The VT102 is a later extension
of that. Both the Linux console and the XTerm emulation implement most of VT102,
with some additions. MS stepped in later and produced another ANSI emulation,
<code>ansi.sys</code>, for their OS, which became of some relevance in BBS style
telecommunication programs. One can view this as a small subset of the VT100 
emulation, with some additions, of cause.
This situation is further confused by the fact, that often many versions of the
above terminals and emulations are out, one able to do a little more or less then
the other.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
I'm working towards a
close integration of the konsole's source code with this document, but it
is still a long way to go.
<p>
Currently, the body of this document is mainly a concept data base, that
referes to the VT100 component of the emulation. Though the codes accepted by
konsole are now clearly indicated, a comparison to the xterm and Linux console
emulation is missing.
<p>
The konsole emulation sources is not linked closely with it's documentation,
and, also accurate at the time of writing, it can still fall slightly appart,
though the codes accepted and produced by konsole should be properly listed.
Work is currently in progress to fix this issue.

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
  In a traditional UNIX installation a single machine (host) served
  several users by means of terminals attached to this host by a serial
  cable. These terminals (end points) where specialized devices, either
  regular ttys (printer with keyboard) or later more sophisticated
  things with cathode ray tubes.
  <p>
  <center><img src="konsole2.gif"></center>
  <p>
  Today, hardware has become so cheap, that each single user could
  be provided with a complete host/display combination for the former
  price of a terminal.
  <p>
  Additional, and here we come to the X in the emulation, display
  devices have become graphical while the original terminal where
  only able to show characters but not graphics.
  <p>
  To allow programs designed for the original configuration to be
  used in the contemporary setup, "terminal emulations" where invented.
  In these emulations, the whole original setup is simulated.
  <p>
  The serial cable is folded into the operating system as a sort of
  loop back device, and a program, the terminal emulation, uses modern
  means of graphical user interfaces to behave like an earlier terminal.
  To complete the picture, the host in the diagram is replaced by the
  application that runs in the emulation (typically a shell or an old
  editor).  So, terminal emulations are in fact interfaces to character
  oriented applications.
  <p>
  This document describes the implementations of a program named
  "konsole", which is such an X terminal emulation. Since konsole
  is distributed under the GPL, meaning that it's source code is
  available to whoever likes to hack on it, the program would be
  incomplete without a proper introduction into the code and it's
  concepts. Thus, this text is to complement the program and the
  source with the remaining informations to make a complete product.
  <p>
  <h2>A first refinement</h2>
  <p>
  Before we can come to the actual implementation, quite some
  notions have to be introduced. We have to get us an idea what
  a terminal emulation does in more detail.
  <p>
  To this end, a simple model of the terminal and it's operation
  is given, which is later extended and refined as we come deeper
  into matter and implementation.
  <p>
  At some level conception, a terminal can be described as a
  (abstract) data model. This means it has some type of state
  together with operations on that data type. These operations
  are somehow encoded to be passed over the serial line.
  <p>
  The concrete model is often loosely named the "emulation",
  the specific encoding chosen, the "protocol".
  <p>
  There are two principle models in use. The first, stream like
  one, which is related to a tty, consideres the terminal as an
  indefinit long and wide sheet of paper on which a printer head
  types the characters that come in over the line. Typical examples
  are shell scripts, make and other programs producing sequential
  protocols of their activity. Their basic data type is a list of
  list of characters.
  <p>
  The second principle model is used by applications written 
  especially for crt devices, so called full screen applications.
  These treat the terminal as a matrix of characters where each
  position can be individually addressed and written to. Typical
  representatives are full screen editors like vi and emacs,
  file managers like mc and mail readers like mutt.
  <p>
  Though the second model is newer, it's age does not imply a
  preference. To the contrary, both models have a right for their
  own and are both to be supported. The first model is fully
  expressed within konsole in form of it's ref:history buffer.
  <p>
  Note, that although the second model definitely build on the
  first one in almost any respect, it cannot fully express it,
  since it introduces a finite line length, while the first
  model works with indefinite lines.
  <p>
  Since application with both view of things are typically run
  within the same session, some effort has been made within
  konsole to maintain both ideas simultaniously, but only with
  limited success so far.
  <p>
  In both models, the notion of a current position (historically
  a printer's head, nowadays visualized by a cursor) is present.
  "Printing" a character at the current position and advancing
  the head together with the starting a new line are the most
  fundamental operations of the emulation.
  <p>
  The full screen model basically adds the possibility to position
  the cursor and to overwrite and clear the screen.
  <p>
  A plethora of additional (more or less useful) commands are
  then added on this by every specific emulation, see below for
  the awful details.
  <p>
  <!-- BEGIN: new section about the codes -->
  <h2>Parts of the model</h2>
  <p>
  <it>All the following in this section is an outline</it>.
  <p>
  Parts of the terminal description
  <ul>
  <li>State
  <br>This is mainly the screen, the cursor (including it's graphical state)
      and some hidden mode variables. Note that the state cannot be investigated
      by the attached host.
  <li>Interface
  <br>That's what goes over the wire. Beside being related to objects, this
      appears so closely related to contemporal process communication, that
      it might be discussed in likely terms.
  <br>We have information flowing in both directions. On could destinguist
      between:
  <li>Commands
  <br>These are "calls" of the terminals interface by the host which cause
      some change of the terminals state, but do not end in a response.
  <li>Requests
  <br>These are "calls" of the terminals interface by the host which do not cause
      any change of the terminals state, but end in a response of the terminal.
      Clearly, requests are somehow used to investigate the state of the terminal.
  <li>Events
  <br>These are signals from the terminal caused by the user affecting the
      mouse or keyboard to the host.
  <li>Replys
  <br>These are send by the terminal as a result of a Request from the hosts.
  <li>Encoding/Decoding
  </ul>

  Conceptually, the commands to the terminal emulation are encoded if form
  of byte sequences to meet the restrictions of the transport media. These
  sequences have pretty different originations and therefore the format of
  the sequences are inhomogenous.
  <p>
  Refering both to their origin and form, one can group the overall encoding
  schemes as follows:

    <td>This is the most original pattern of all. The characters to be
        displayed are passed over the chanel and are interpreted by the
        terminal (emulation) as instructions to display the corresponding
        glyph of the ascii character set. Contempory emulations include the
        upper half (128..255) of the extentions to the national ascii character
        sets, also.</td></tr>

    <td>Ascii defines some non-printable, but format effecting characters, too.

  <h3>More on Control Sequences</h3>
  <p>
  <h4>Control Characters</h4>
  <p>
  Control characters (codes 0x00 - 0x1f inclusive) are specifically excluded
  from the control sequence syntax, but may be embedded within a control
  sequence.  Embedded control characters are executed as soon as they are
  encountered by a VT100.  The processing of the control sequence then
  continues with the next character received.  The exceptions are:
  if the <a href=#ESC>ESC</a> character occurs, the current control sequence
  is aborted, and a new one commences beginning with the <a href=#ESC>ESC</a>
  just received.  If the character <a href=#CAN>CAN</a> (0x0c) or the
  character <a href=#SUB>SUB</a> (0x0e) occurs,
  the current control sequence is aborted.  The ability to embed control
  characters allows the synchronization characters XON and XOFF to be
  interpreted properly without affecting the control sequence.
  <p>
  <p>
  <h4>CSI Sequences</h4>
  <p>
  <dl>
  <dt>Control Sequence Introducer (CSI):
  <dd>An escape sequence that provides
      supplementary controls and is itself a prefix affecting the
      interpretation of a limited number of contiguous characters.
      In the VT100, the CSI is: &lt;ESC&gt;[
  <p>
  <dt>Parameter:
  <dd>1. A string of zero or more decimal characters which
         represent a single value.  Leading zeros are ignored.  The
         decimal characters have a range of 0 (060) to 9 (071).
  <br>2. The value so represented.
  <p>
  <dt>Numeric Parameter:
  <dd>A parameter that represents a number, designated by Pn.
  <p>
  <dt>Selective Parameter:
  <dd>A parameter that selects a subfunction from a
      specified set of subfunctions, designated by Ps.  In general, a
      control sequence with more than one selective parameter causes
      the same effect as several control sequences, each with one
      selective parameter, e.g., CSI Psa; Psb; Psc F is identical to
      CSI Psa F CSI Psb F CSI Psc F.
  <p>
  <dt>Parameter String:
  <dd>A string of parameters separated by a semicolon.
  <p>
  <dt>Default:
  <dd> A function-dependent value that is assumed when no explicit
       value, or a value of 0, is specified.
  <p>
  <dt>Final character:
  <dd>A character whose bit combination terminates an escape or control sequence.
  </dl>
  <p>
  <em>EXAMPLE</em>:  Control sequence to turn off all character attributes, then
  turn on underscore and blink attributes (<a href=#SGR>SGR</a>).
  <p>
  <center><img src="konsole1.gif"></center>
  <p>
  The octal representation of this string is:
  <pre>
     033 0133 060 073 064 073 065 0155
    &lt;ESC&gt;   [   0   ;   4   ;   5    m
  </pre>
  <p>
  Alternate sequences which will accomplish the same thing:
  <p>
  <ul>
  <li><code>&lt;ESC&gt;[;4;m     </code>
  <li><code>&lt;ESC&gt;[m        </code>
  <br><code>&lt;ESC&gt;[4m       </code>
  <br><code>&lt;ESC&gt;[5m       </code>
  <li><code>&lt;ESC&gt;[0;04;005m</code>
  </ul>
  <p>
  <h4>DEC hacks</h4>
  <p>
  These form two groups of commands.
  <p>
  In one first the first character is a hash (<em>#</em>) and the following a digit.
  This command group is used to denote VT100 specific instructions and can
  safely be sonsidered to be obsolete. See
    <a href=#DECALN>DECALN</a>,
    <a href=#DECDHLB>DECDHLB</a>,
    <a href=#DECDHLT>DECDHLT</a>,
    <a href=#DECDWL>DECDWL</a> and
    <a href=#DECSWL>DECSWL</a>.
  <p>
  The second one is used to specify character set mappings (see <a
  href=#SCS>SCS</a>). A CSI instruction to do this is specified in ECMA,
  and this should be used as a replacement.
  <p>

  <p>
  All of the following control sequences are transmitted from the Host to
  VT100 unless otherwise noted.  All of the control sequences are a subset of
  those defined in ANSI X 3.64 1977 and ANSI X 3.41 1974.
  <p>
  The following text conforms to these formatting conventions:
  <ul>
  <li>Individual character literals are set in bold face. Ascii representation
      is used throughout, so <b>ESC</b> means the binary value of 27 and
      <b>[</b> a value of 91.
  <p>
  <li>Parameters are indicated by italic type faces.
  <li>Parameter types usually are indicated as one of:
      <table>
      <tr><td><i>Pn </i></td><td>A string of digits representing a numerical value.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><i>Ps </i></td><td>A character that selects an item from a list.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><i>a-z</i></td><td>Any lowercase sequence of one or more
                          characters represent a value to be
                          entered (as in <i>Pn</i>), and the name in the
                          will be referred to in explanatory text.</td></tr>
      </table>
  <p>
  <li>Spaces are used only to improve readability, they do not occure in the
      control sequences unless otherwise indicated.

  The following attributes below have the following meaning:
  <ul>
  <li>VT100 - This code is known to VT100.
  <li>ANSI  - This code is defined by ANSI.
  <li>DEC   - This code is DEC private.
  <li>Command - Sent from host to the terminal. <b>FIXME:</b>add Inquiery.
  <li>Reply - Sent from terminal to the host (as response to an Inquiery).
  <li>Event - Sent from terminal to the host (caused by a user activity).

  state causes the origin (or home position) to be the upper left
  character position of the screen.  Line and column numbers are,
  therefore, independent of current margin settings.  The cursor may be
  positioned outside the margins with a cursor position (<a href=#CUP>CUP</a>) or
  horizontal and vertical position (<a href=#HVP>HVP</a>) control.

  The set state causes the origin to be at the upper left character
  position within the current margins.  Line and column numbers are,
  therefore, relative to the current margin settings.  The cursor cannot
  be positioned outside of the margins.

  The cursor is moved to the new home position when this mode is set or
  reset.  Lines and columns are numbered consecutively, with the origin
  being line 1, column 1.

The VT100 is an upward and downward software-compatible terminal;
that is, previous Digital video terminals have Digital's private standards
for control sequences. The American National Standards Institute has since
standardized escape and control sequences in terminals in documents X3.41-1974
and X3.64-1977.
<p>
The VT100 is compatible with both the previous Digital standard and
ANSI standards.  Customers may use existing Digital software designed around
the VT52 or new VT100 software.  The VT100 has a "VT52 compatible" mode in
which the VT100 responds to control sequences like a VT52.  In this mode, most
of the new VT100 features cannot be used.
<p>
Throughout this document references will be made to "VT52 mode" or
"ANSI mode".  These two terms are used to indicate the VT100's software
compatibility.
<p>
<em>NOTE</em>: The ANSI standards allow the manufacturer flexibility in implementing
each function.  This document describes how the VT100 will respond to the
implemented ANSI central function.

<em>NOTE 1</em>: Codes 0152-0156 and 0164-0170 are used to draw rectangular grids" each
piece of this set is contiguous with other so the lines formed will be
unbroken.
<p>
<em>NOTE 2</em>: Codes 0157-0163 give better vertical resolution than dashes and
underlines when drawing graphs; using these segments, 120 x 132 resolution may
be obtained in 132 column mode with the Advanced Video Option installed.
