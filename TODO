- deflicker, setting all the attributes separately
  both when creating and changing to a session
  creates 3 setimage and 1 paint events.

- when manipulating binary files, sometimes one
  screws up ones terminal settings.  xterm has
  a convenient 'hard reset' menu choice. Further
  killing individual sessions would be nice to have.

- when removing and adding the menu, the window
  remains the same size, meaning that the number of
  rows changes.  For applications that do not take
  kindly to this, it would be nice if the window
  changed sizes and the number of rows remained the same.

- make resizing more clever
  to see the issue, 'ls /dev', make window smaller
  and then larger again.

- introduce the concept of "logical lines" for resizing and
  cut'n'paste.

- complete command line options
  - emit undecodeable sequences only on on demand (-d).
  - font, menu, scrollbar, ... other configs
  - deal with unrecognized options

- complete session awareness
  - save *all* konsole sessions, not only the primary.

- implement kvt features
  - awareness of gui style change

- improve/complete documentation

- check through FIXMEs
- clean up code

- dynamic buffer adjustment or configurability.
- clear buffer facility.

- i18n improvements?

- write configuration utility at least for *.schema files.

- evtl. handle *.kdelnk files using regular setup utilities
  and a rpc client. Should become a parameter in any case.

- allow reloading the configuration files at runtime.

- Unix98 compatible way of using pty (openpty/forkpty).

! announce konsole-1.0 ------------------------------------

- check for other codes/features (Linux console, xterm)
  - change xterm title hack to respect icon instruction?
  - secure keyboard? (check other security issues)
  - media copy (print)
  - double high, double width (vt100)
  - reverse wraparound?

- Linux console improvements
  - Attributes
    - underline --> intensive foreground
    - blink     --> intensive background
  - Linux console knows some extra tricks mapping graphical
    characters.

- Fonts
  - produce font families instead of doing underline and bold
    in the program?
  - use scalable font?
  - allow fonts being configured freely

- add configuration for function keys

- /dev/console?

- selecting lines that wraps insert a '\n' in the middle of the
  line when pasting. A related problem occures with resizing.

- reintegrate kom (modem stuff).

- fix non-numeric keypad (It's a QT issue really)

- check for VT100 SETUP (doc/More/vt100-setup.txt)

- VT100 keypad codes (doc/missing.keys, pass vttest section 5)
- proper schema manager?

- It might be nice to be able to resize the terminal emulation screen 
  size and widget screen size independently, so that one could use a
  132 column xterm emulation, showing only 60 columns on the screen,
  with horizontal scrolling to follow the cursor.  Default would be
  to have the two slaved like now, but one could use the menubar to 
  disassociate them.  This would allow, for example, one to read reports 
  that are too wide for the screen, or the use of normal tools on
  very narrow screens.
